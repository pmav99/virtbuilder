## `virtbuilder`

### Installation

#### `pipx`

The recommended installation method is [pipx](https://github.com/cs01/pipx).  More
specifically, you can install `virtbuilder` for your user with:

```
pipx install virtbuilder
```

The above command will create a virtual environment in `~/.local/pipx/venvs/virtbuilder`
and add the `virtbuilder` script in `~/.local/bin`.

#### `pip`

Alternatively you can use good old `pip` but this is more fragile than `pipx`.

``` bash
pip install --user virtbuilder
```
